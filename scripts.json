The purpose of this test is to better understand the association between stress and blood glucose levels.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to confirm a few things. Firstly, could you please ensure that your video window is expanded to full screen? Can you hear and see me well?\nThis challenge should take about 30 minutes and thereafter you'll be expected to consume the (e.g., [see challenge tracker for type of beverage]) beverage provided to you and will have to refrain from exercise activities for 90 minutes. Ideally, you stay seated for this time. Do you still have adequate time this morning to complete this full procedure?\nDo you have the provided beverage nearby, ready to consume?\nYou are expected to fast for 8 hours prior to this challenge, and reduce stress-inducing activities prior to. Were you able to fast? Is there anything you did this morning that you want to mention that involved strenuous exercise, or a stressful exposure?\nCould you please make sure you have your smartphone nearby and open up the MyT1Diabetes app. Please put your phone on silent for the duration of this procedure, and avoid looking at or checking your phone unless instructed by me.\nLastly, could you confirm that you are wearing all of your study devices. This includes the Empatica EmbracePlus, the Oura ring, and the CGM. Are the devices all charged and working?",
